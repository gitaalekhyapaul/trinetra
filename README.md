## Problem Statement

Students face problems knowing their exact timetable every day as the teacher gets busy with some other work and hence cancel the class and sometimes even take an extra class. Most of the colleges across the globe provide a variety of courses and each course has different faculties to teach them. So, it is a tedious task to inform the student about the change in timetable. Trinetra is a timetable application that aims to solve this problem. We want to create a dynamic timetable generator which the teachers and the students can refer to during their college hours.
